I am currently a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) in the [UTDA Lab](https://www.cerc.utexas.edu/utda/).
Previously, I completed my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2019.
As an undergrad researcher, I worked with Prof. [Yao-Wen Chang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~ywchang/) in EDA Lab, and Prof. [Jie-Hong R. Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/) in ALCOM Lab.
My research interests include physical design, logic synthesis, and emerging technology in VLSI CAD.

I have received the 2nd-place award in the CAD contest at ICCAD 2018, and the 2nd-place award in the Initial Detailed Routing contest of ISPD 2018.
I have interned at Synopsys.
